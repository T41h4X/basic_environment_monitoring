# basic_environment_monitoring_system
This project showcases an Arduino-based sensor system that measures air quality, temperature, and humidity using DHT11/DHT22 and MQ-2 sensors. The data is displayed on an SSD1306 OLED screen, and a software-based real-time clock (RTC) is implemented for timestamping. Ideal for IoT applications and smart environmental monitoring.
